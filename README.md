## Setup

Prerequisites: 

`Mongodb` (project built using v4.0.6)
`Node` (project built using  v11.12.0)

First start a local Mongo Connection on port `27017`.

To start the frontend & backend of the application run:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

This will start the frontend on port `3000` and the backend on port `3001`.

You can also start each part seperately by running `npm start` in their respective folders.
